                    <h3>Planetary Scatterplot</h3>
                    <p>This visualization shows the planets of our solar system as a scatterplot. The chart presents each planet's distance from the sun, density, and size in relation to the other planets. More data can be added to the tooltip or added as a animatable field on the chart.</p>
                    <p>The x-axis is the planet's distance from the sun (miles). The y-axis is the planet's density (kg pr. cubic meter). The radius of each circle is its radius in relation to the other planets.</p>
                    <p>Hover over the circle to see the planet's name. I know Pluto isn't considered a planet any more, but it felt lonely being left out.</p>
